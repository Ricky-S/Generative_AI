# What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is one of the biggest recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology because of its ability to create something new. It opens the door to an entire world of possibilities for human-computer interaction and is the core technology behind the next generation of AI applications.

## Key Features of Generative AI

- **Innovative Content Creation:**
  - **Text**
  - **Images**
  - **Audio**

## Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI has a vast array of applications across different domains. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Web Search Enhancements**
   - Improving search algorithms to provide more relevant and personalized results.
2. **Fraud Detection**
   - Utilizing pattern recognition to identify and prevent fraudulent activities.
3. **Recommendation Systems**
   - Enhancing user experience by providing personalized recommendations in various sectors like e-commerce, streaming services, etc.



## Supervised Learning (labeling things)


## Generating text using large language models (LLMs)

prompt -> model -> output.

LLM are built by using supervised learning to repeatedly predict the next word in a sequence of words.

LLM could be a thought partner to think through how to make a strange pie (no source on the internet).

## Examples

+ Writing

+ Reading
  + proofread the following text, intended for ..., for spelling and grammar errors, and rewrite it with corrections.
  + Summarize the following paper in 300 words.
  + summarizing call center conversations. 
  + Customer email analysis: Read the email below and choose the most appropriate department to route the email to.(state the task you want the model to carry out) Choose the department from the following list: Apparel, electronics, home applications.(provide the choices for the model). [email text].
  + Reputation monitoring. Read the following review and classify it has having either positive or negative sentiment.  [review text].

+ Chatting 
  + specialized chatbots.
  + IT service chatbot. human only, bots support humans (human in the loop), bot triages for humans, chatbots only.


Advice for deploying chatbots.

+ start with an internal-facing chatbot. 
  + work with staff to assess behavior of chatbot.
  + avoid public mistakes.
+ Deploy with human in the loop to check for mistakes.
+ only after deemed safe, allow bot to communicate directly with customers..





## Web-based vs. software-based application use of LLMs

Web-based interface applications e.g. chatgpt, bard.

software-based applications e.g. email routing, document search.

## what LLMs can and cannot do

+ Generate AI works best with unstructured data. (text, images, audio, video, etc.)
+ 


+ knowledge cutoffs. all LLM's knowledge of the world is frozen at the time of its training.
+ make things up. Hallucinations.
+ the input and output length is limited. up to a few thousand words.
+ Generative AI does not work well with structured data.
+ Bias and Toxicity.


## Tips for prompting

+ Be detailed and specific.
  + Give sufficient context.

+ Guide the model to think through its answer.
  +  step 1:5 fun, joyful words that relate to cats
  +  step 2:Rhyming names for a toy based on those words
  +  step 3:Add a fun, relevant emoji for each toy name

+ Experiment and iterate
  + No perfect prompt for every person or situation. Instead, better to develop process for improving prompts through iteration.
  + help me rewrite this: ...
  + correct any grammatical and spelling errors in this: ... 
  + Correct any grammatical and spelling errors in this,and rewrite in a tone appropriate for a professional resume. ...

+ idea->prompt->LLM response->idea...
   + be clear and specific in prompt.
   + think results
   + refine prompt
   + repeat


## Image generation (diffusion model)

Generate picture completely at random.



### Future Prospects

The future of generative AI is promising and is expected to revolutionize various industries. From automating creative processes to aiding in complex decision-making, the potential is limitless.
